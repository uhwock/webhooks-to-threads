# Webhooks -> Threads

With this simple python script you will now be able to send webhooks in threads. 

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+

### Installation

```
$ pip install requests
$ pip install pystyle
$ py webhooktothreads.py
```

# Using a JSON for the Embed

When using the script it will ask for a JSON file path, The JSON file is what contains the webhook data and to make an embed in JSON you can use [Discohook](https://discohook.org/)

You can now make an embed or whatever you'd like and once you're done near the bottom is a box that says "JSON Data Editor", Open it then copy and paste the data into the `embed.json` file and you're done.

If you have the `webhooktothreads.py` & `embed.json` in a folder you're able to just input "embed.json" when it asks for a file path aswell.
